# GitHub Copilot Instructions - Berapit Procurement Dashboard

## Project Overview
**Stack:** Laravel 11 + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4 + DaisyUI + GridStack.js  
**Purpose:** Drag-and-drop dashboard builder for procurement analytics with Google Sheets integration  
**Architecture:** Server-side rendering (Blade) with client-side interactivity via vanilla JavaScript

---

## Core Architectural Patterns

### Widget System Architecture
The dashboard uses a **template-based widget system** with GridStack.js for layout:
* `resources/js/widget-templates.js` defines all widget types (KPI cards, charts, metrics, status)
* `resources/js/canvas-manager.js` handles drag-drop, positioning, zoom, and persistence
* Widgets render server-side via Blade components in `resources/views/components/`
* Widget HTML is generated by template `render()` functions returning string literals

**Widget Creation Flow:**
```
Sidebar (sidebar.blade.php) → User drags widget → 
canvas-manager.js captures drop → Looks up template → 
Renders HTML via template.render(id) → Injects into GridStack
```

### Data Flow Pattern
* **No heavy frontend framework** - uses vanilla JS + Blade for simplicity
* **Google Sheets as source of truth** (see `ref/init_requirement_gathering.md`)
* Future: Laravel controllers will fetch data via Google Sheets API → pass to Blade → render widgets
* Real-time updates via polling (setInterval in widget-templates.js for live metrics)

### Theme System
* DaisyUI themes defined in `tailwind.config.js` ("industrial", "industrial-light")
* Theme switching via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` element
* CSS variables for glassmorphic effects in `resources/css/app.css`
* All components use semantic theme classes (e.g., `theme-strong-text`, `glass`)

---

## Development Workflows

### Running the Application
```bash
composer dev  # Runs Laravel server + queue worker + Vite dev server concurrently
```
This single command starts:
* `php artisan serve` on http://localhost:8000
* `php artisan queue:listen` for background jobs
* `npm run dev` for hot module replacement

**Testing:**
```bash
composer test  # Clears config cache + runs Pest tests
```

### Asset Compilation
* Vite watches `resources/css/app.css` and `resources/js/app.js`
* Auto-compiles on change when running `composer dev`
* Production build: `npm run build` → outputs to `public/build/`

### Database Migrations
* Current state: No database (Google Sheets-only)
* Future: Add migrations for dashboard persistence (see feasibility study in `ref/widget-builder-feasibility.md`)

---

## File Organization Conventions

### Blade Component Structure
```
resources/views/
  dashboard.blade.php        # Main layout (includes navbar, tabs, sidebar, canvas)
  components/
    navbar.blade.php         # Top bar with theme switcher
    tab-bar.blade.php        # Multiple dashboard tabs
    sidebar.blade.php        # Widget toolbox (drag sources)
    canvas.blade.php         # GridStack drop zone
```

**Pattern:** Components are self-contained with inline `<script>` tags for isolated interactivity.

### JavaScript Module Pattern
* Entry point: `resources/js/app.js` imports `canvas-manager.js` and `widget-templates.js`
* Widget templates export an object literal keyed by widget type
* Manager exports functions as named exports (`initializeCanvas`, `addWidget`)

### CSS Organization
```
resources/css/
  app.css                    # Main stylesheet (Tailwind + custom utilities)
  partials/                  # Future: Split theme-specific styles here
```

**Custom CSS Pattern:** Use Tailwind utilities first, custom CSS only for glassmorphism/animations not in Tailwind.

---

## Code Style & Patterns

### Widget Template Structure
Every widget in `widget-templates.js` follows this schema:
```javascript
'widget-name': {
  title: 'Display Name',
  width: 20,        // GridStack columns (80-column grid)
  height: 6,        // Grid rows (20px per row)
  render: (id) => `...HTML string...`
}
```
* **Always include a close button** with `onclick="removeWidget('${id}')"`
* **Use group hover states** for edit/close buttons (`.opacity-0 .group-hover:opacity-100`)
* **Embed inline SVGs** for icons (from Lucide or custom)

### GridStack Configuration
* Grid: 80 columns × 20px cell height = precise layout control
* Fixed canvas width: 1600px (defined in canvas-manager.js)
* `float: false` prevents auto-reflow (user controls layout)
* `disableOneColumnMode: true` maintains grid even on small screens

### Blade Templating Patterns
* Use `{{ }}` for escaped output, `{!! !!}` only for trusted HTML
* Component inclusion: `@include('components.navbar')` (no props needed for stateless components)
* Asset loading: `@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])` in `<head>`

---

## Project-Specific Gotchas

### GridStack HTML Escaping Issue
**Problem:** GridStack's `addWidget()` escapes HTML in the `content` parameter.  
**Solution:** Create widget first, then manually inject HTML via `.innerHTML`:
```javascript
const addedWidget = grid.addWidget({ id, w, h, x, y });
addedWidget.querySelector('.grid-stack-item-content').innerHTML = template.render(id);
```
See `canvas-manager.js:addWidget()` for reference.

### Sidebar State Management
* Sidebar toggles between 240px (expanded) and 48px (collapsed)
* Dispatches `sidebar-toggle` custom event for canvas margin adjustment
* Canvas listens via `window.addEventListener('sidebar-toggle', ...)` in canvas-manager.js

### Zoom Implementation
* Canvas uses CSS `transform: scale()` for zoom
* Grid background must scale with zoom (see `applyZoom()` in canvas-manager.js)
* Fixed 1600px base width prevents layout shift during zoom

### Theme Switching
* Persist theme in `localStorage` via `setTheme()` function in navbar.blade.php
* DaisyUI automatically applies theme colors when `data-theme` changes
* Custom CSS uses theme-aware classes defined in app.css

---

## Key Requirements from Requirements Doc

### Data Source
* **Must use Google Sheets API** (Sheet ID: `1RooX6rBh6AyIkBUKdX4ZijUr8Gk93Bi4`)
* Worksheets: "PO" (Purchase Orders) and "Vendor" (Vendor data)
* No database migration allowed - Sheets is source of truth

### Dashboard 1 Requirements (PO-Centric)
* **KPI Cards:** Total PO Value, Outstanding Amount, Active Vendors, PO Count with % change
* **Charts:** Line (trends), Bar (categories), Funnel (status), Treemap (category distribution)
* **Vendor Analytics:** Top 10 vendors, concentration pie chart, outstanding amounts table
* **Payment Health:** Aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 120+ days), overdue alerts

### Performance Targets
* Dashboard load: ≤3 seconds
* Chart rendering: ≤1 second
* Filter updates: ≤500ms
* Support up to 10,000 PO records

---

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Setup
* **Framework:** Pest (modern PHPUnit wrapper)
* **Test locations:** `tests/Feature/` and `tests/Unit/`
* **Run command:** `composer test` (clears config cache first)

### Widget Testing Pattern
When adding new widgets:
* Test template render output structure (HTML validation)
* Test drag-drop interaction in browser (manual for now)
* Verify responsiveness at 1920px, 1366px, and 768px widths

---

## Extending the System

### Adding a New Widget Type
* [ ] Define template in `widget-templates.js` (title, width, height, render function)
* [ ] Add entry to `sidebar.blade.php` with drag handle and icon
* [ ] Update GridStack column/height if widget needs non-standard size
* [ ] Test drag-drop to canvas and verify render output

### Integrating Google Sheets API
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Google Sheets integration is complete:
* `config/google-sheets.php` - Configuration with worksheet names and cache settings
* `app/Services/GoogleSheetsService.php` - Service class for API interactions
* `app/Http/Controllers/Api/DashboardController.php` - API endpoints for dashboard data
* API routes in `routes/web.php`:
  - `GET /api/dashboard/data` - All data (PO + Vendor)
  - `GET /api/dashboard/purchase-orders` - Purchase orders only
  - `GET /api/dashboard/vendors` - Vendor data only
  - `POST /api/dashboard/cache/clear` - Clear cache manually
  - `GET /api/dashboard/test-connection` - Test API connection

**Environment Variables:**
```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_PATH=storage/app/google-service-account.json
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=1dNk1A7y6JqotDdd0zlnDpwiUZTvn1gEx
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CACHE_ENABLED=true
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CACHE_TTL=300  # seconds
```

**Service Account Setup:**
* Service account email: `apikey1@bmpreview.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
* JSON credentials stored in `storage/app/google-service-account.json`
* Sheet must be shared with service account email (Viewer permissions)

**Usage in Widgets:**
```javascript
// Fetch data in widget-templates.js
fetch('/api/dashboard/purchase-orders')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    // data.data contains array of PO records
    // data.count contains total record count
  });
```

### Adding Dashboard Persistence
See `ref/widget-builder-feasibility.md` for full architecture. Key steps:
* [ ] Create migration for `dashboard_layouts` table (user_id, name, widgets JSON)
* [ ] Add Laravel API routes (`/api/dashboards/save`, `/api/dashboards/load`)
* [ ] Implement `DashboardController` CRUD methods
* [ ] Add save/load UI buttons to navbar.blade.php
* [ ] Serialize GridStack state via `grid.save()` and store in database

---

## Non-Linear Development Protocol

**Systems Thinking > Sequential Planning**
* Map component relationships before coding (Context Map)
* Break work into independent atomic units (no "Step 1, Step 2...")
* Re-evaluate approach with fresh context on each change
* Treat documentation as external working memory, not chronological plans

**When Implementing:**
* Show changed files/functions only (pseudo-diffs)
* Prioritize spatial layouts (tables, lists) over prose
* Ignore sunk cost - abandon old approach if new context reveals better path

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.14
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests which have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider going with this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>


=== pest/v4 rules ===

## Pest 4

- Pest v4 is a huge upgrade to Pest and offers: browser testing, smoke testing, visual regression testing, test sharding, and faster type coverage.
- Browser testing is incredibly powerful and useful for this project.
- Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for detailed guidance on utilizing these features.

### Browser Testing
- You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest v4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.) when appropriate to complete the test.
- If requested, test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- If requested, test on different devices and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints).
- Switch color schemes (light/dark mode) when appropriate.
- Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Pest Browser Test Example" lang="php">
it('may reset the password', function () {
    Notification::fake();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in'); // Visit on a real browser...

    $page->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors() // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->fill('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->click('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Pest Smoke Testing Example" lang="php">
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertNoJavascriptErrors()->assertNoConsoleLogs();
</code-snippet>


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.
<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |
</laravel-boost-guidelines>
